# timed-writing-app
Writing session ends when user hasn't written anything in a customizable length of time.

A writing app with both a session timer and a short 1 to 10 seconds "interval" timer that ends the session if the user
hasn't written anything before it reaches zero. When either timer reaches zero, the word count and total time spent
writing are displayed. The user has the option to reset the writing pad or export their writing to file.
This app is designed to help users not overthink when writing. Good for stream of conscious writing.
